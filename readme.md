# Creating a Business Website project

This was a project to test my flexbox ability. **This is entirely a parody website. Do not take anything seriously**

## Title: Ex-treme Hate

The premise of the business is to cause grief to mean ex partners.

There is an about sections and fake testimonials, as well as a clickable breadcrumb nav bar.

## Struggles with the Project

There's a lot of this I struggled with, like the about section isn't completely what I like, and I still need to play with it so it's more responsive on other displays. (especially for mobile)

## What I learned

More confidently how to use flexbox. (although there is always room for improvements!)
